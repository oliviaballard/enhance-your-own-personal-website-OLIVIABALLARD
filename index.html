	<h2>A Little About Me!</h2>
	<p>Hi! My name is Olivia and I am a senior Business Administration major and Marketing minor at Cedar Crest College. I currently am working part-time at Victaulic in the Customer Care department after being an intern over the summer. I am on the BA & tech team! I love what I do now but I'm hoping to eventually make my way into doing something more involved with digital marketing, but more specifically social media marketing.</p>

<h2>My Hobbies & Interests</h2>

<section>
	<p>One of my hobbies right now is pickleball. I've done sports pretty much my whole life. I started with soccer, then did gymnastics for a long time, started playing volleyball, and just recently stopped after my freshman year of college. I missed. Being competitive and also being active so when my mom invited me to play with her I decided to give it a try. I had so much fun playing and realized how much I missed being competitive. I try to play as much as I can now. Another interest I have is in cars. My dad has had numerous Mustang models over the years and is also into cars himself, so I've always been around it. My dad & I differ now based on taste since I'm more of a German engineering fan, while he's more American muscle. We definitely butt heads sometimes... In the future, I'd love to have either an M5 Competition or an RS6 Avant.</p>
